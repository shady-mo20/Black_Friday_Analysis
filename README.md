# Black_Friday_Analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python's pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries. The project aimed to analyze a dataset related to Black Friday sales and gain insights into customer behavior and purchase patterns.

I started by loading the dataset using pandas and performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values in columns like 'Product_Category_2' and 'Product_Category_3'. I converted categorical features like 'Gender', 'Age', 'City_Category', and 'Stay_In_Current_City_Years' into numerical values using label encoding.

The EDA phase involved visualizing various aspects of the dataset to uncover trends and patterns. I used bar plots, pie charts, box plots, and other visualization techniques to understand customer demographics, purchase behavior, and the impact of different features on purchase amounts. For instance, I analyzed the distribution of purchases across different age groups, city categories, and product categories. I also examined the correlation between features and the target variable ('Purchase') using a heatmap.

To enhance feature engineering, I created new aggregated features like mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum based on existing features. This allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of how the features collectively influence purchase behavior.

The project helped me develop strong data analysis skills, including data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis. Through this hands-on experience, I gained insights into customer preferences and behavior during Black Friday sales, which can be valuable for future marketing and sales strategies."
